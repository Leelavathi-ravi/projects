A Real-Time Heart Rate Monitoring System using ESP8266 NodeMCU for Enhanced Health
Management.
Introduction: The Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) revolutionizes industrial processes by
fostering interconnected devices and data collection for enhanced performance and worker
safety. Monitoring heart rate is crucial for assessing cardiovascular health and well-being.
Traditional methods often require dedicated equipment or clinical settings. This project
proposes a novel approach using the Internet of Things (IoT) for real-time heart rate
monitoring.
Objective: The objective of this project is to develop an IoT-based heart rate monitoring
system using the ESP8266 NodeMCU microcontroller. This system aims to provide a
convenient, cost-effective, and readily available solution for individuals to track their heart rate
and gain insights into their health.
Methodology:
1. Hardware Selection: The project will utilize an ESP8266 NodeMCU board as the primary
controller due to its affordability, ease of use, and Wi-Fi connectivity.
2. Sensor Integration: A pulse sensor will be integrated with the ESP8266 to detect changes in
blood volume associated with each heartbeat.
3. Signal Processing: The acquired raw signal from the pulse sensor will be processed using
appropriate algorithms (e.g., peak detection) to extract the heart rate data.
4. Data Visualization and Storage: The extracted heart rate data will be transmitted wirelessly
via Wi-Fi to a chosen platform (e.g., smartphone app, cloud-based dashboard) for real-time
visualization and potential storage for historical analysis.
Conclusion: This project demonstrates the feasibility of an ESP8266 NodeMCU-based heart
rate monitoring system. This system offers a user-friendly and cost-effective approach to
promoting health awareness and providing valuable data for individuals to manage their wellbeing.
Additionally, this project contributes to the growing exploration of IoT applications in
the realm of personal health monitoring.
